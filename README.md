# QShell
An idea I had in class in a language I don't know (C)
## What's the use?
Good question. It's being made just for fun, but it SHOULD work in both linux and windows.
## Versioning
Previous versions will not be updated at all. <sup>1</sup>
Versions come in X.Y.Z format (Major.Minor.Patch).
## Exceptions / other stuff
1. only if the update is of major importance (e.g. command not working / wont compile correctly)

I'm also using GitHub workflows for the first time, so expect a LOT of failed ones.
